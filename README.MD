This project focuses on integrating gemini pro model with 
basic sqlite database consisting of 4 records. Here is the representation of project

input --->   Gemini pro   --->   generates   --->   that is used to retrive the 
text         LLM model           SQL query         information from our sqlite database
                
I have designed a seperate prompt template to tell our model how to act
